        <p>Langauge acquisition often refers to the process of learning (or acquiring)
        a language through natural processes. This is often the process with which
        young children gain the ability to speak their native tongue. No grammar rules,
        no formal classrooms, and no graded assignments. It is one of the many miracles 
        of our human existence, and it has long been something that has absolutely 
        captured my attention.
        </p>
        <p>As a result of this fascination, the question that has been on my 
        mind is how I, as an adult, can replicate the process of native 
        language acquisition in my pursuit of becoming a polyglot. 
        </p>
        <p>Please read below to see some of my own thoughts and devised strategies 
        on how I can acquire language naturally. I have also included my list of 
        languages that currently hold my interest and a little bit about their origin
        countries.

        <h3>Strategies for Language Acquisition</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Media
                <ul>
                    <li>Books - Books often offer a natural view of language and 
                        its written form. Diving into a book in a foreign language 
                        gives you a sense of that langauges natural grammatical structure 
                        and syntax without typical grammar lessons. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Videos and Movies - Watching media of native speakers of your 
                        target language is probably one of the most important things you 
                        could incorporate if you do not have a real life native speaker at 
                        your disposal. This approach will give you a sense of how the tones 
                        of your target lagnuage shift and change during speech and it gives you 
                        the luxury of pausing and rewinding in the event of misunderstandings. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Music - This beautiful tool not only makes natural language acquisition 
                        fun, but it also allows you to dive into the colloquial sayings, idioms, 
                        metaphors, and similes that make a language colorful and unique. 

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
            <li>Friends
                <ul>
                    <li>Real native speakers are simply the most efficient way to 
                        learn a langauge. If one is not immersed in their target language, they will 
                        find it difficult to keep that knowledge at the forefront of their lives. Further, 
                        if a learner has no friends with whom to practice the language in addition to 
                        not being immersed in that langauge, it increases the difficulty to a much higher 
                        degree. Although it sounds obvious, the importance of friends (native speakers or fellow learners) 
                        cannot be overstated.

            <li>Thoughts
                <ul>
                    <li>This point may sound silly or obscure, still I have learned from personal 
                        experience that it is one of the most useful and easy to implement. When one finds 
                        that they lack access to media or fellow speakers of their target language, what else 
                        can be done to practice and run through vocabulary? The only simple answer 
                        is to practice thinking in that language. Shifting one's thoughts to view the 
                        world through the lense of a different tongue can be awkward at first, but it is 
                        a necessary step that each learner must take if they hope to acheive proficiency in 
                        that new tongue. A learner should start simply by naming things that they see 
                        every day in their new language, and let it progress into sentences fromt their 
                        as they build their vocabularly and knowledge of the langauge's structure.
